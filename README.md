# Henderson-Painter-Language-HPL
This is the repository for code written for a Language Processors course offered at the University of the West Indies, Mona Campus. The description of both the Language and the problem are provided as pdf files in the repository. The application was given a  75/60. Unfortunately I haven't made a makefile as yet but to run you can modify the runner.c file appropriately compile and run and it should be good. All
