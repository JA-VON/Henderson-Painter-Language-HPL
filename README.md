# Henderson Painter Language(HPL) Interpreter
This is the repository for code written for an interpreter for a Language Processors course offered at the University of the West Indies, Mona Campus. JLex is used for the Lexer and cup is used for the Parser. The description of both the Language and the problem are provided as pdf files in the repository. 

# Instructions on how to run

To run just execute the following command from the command line in the src directory:
```
java -cp "java_cup.runtime.jar:." hpl/sys/HPLRepl 
```

#Contributing
Unfortunately I haven't made a makefile as yet, but to run you can modify the runner.c file appropriately, then compile and run it.
